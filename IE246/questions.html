               <li>Write a Java code that prints all the numbers between 0 and 1500 that are divisible by 7 but not by 3 on the screen.</li>
               
               <li>Write a Java code that prints sum of digit values for the numbers between 350 and 2570 that are not divisible by 7. For instance, sum of digit values of 375 is 3+7+5=15. </li>

               <li> <img src="images/hw.png" style="height:38px;" alt="Homework">Write a for loop that prints the factorial of an integer on the screen. So the for loop should follow, for instance <code>int number=4;</code> and write <code>4!=24</code> on the screen.</li>
               
                <li>Without compiling/running, predict what the following codes would output on the screen. If you think it would give an error during runtime or compilation, indicate the reason for the error and how it can be fixed.

               <ol>
               
    <li>Write a Java code that prints all the letters in the alphabet in lowercase (char decimals 97-122) in a single line without any space in between.</li>
               
    <li>Write a Java code that prints all the letters in the alphabet in lowercase (5 letters per line) without any space in between.</li>

    <li>Write a Java code that prints all the letters in the alphabet in lowercase (move to the next line if e or t is to be printed next) with one space in between.</li>

    <li>We can cast a long into an int without any information loss. True or False?</li>
    
    <li><img src="images/hw.png" style="height:38px;" alt="Homework">Write a Java code that prints the prime numbers between 350 and 2570.</li>

    <li><img src="images/hw.png" style="height:38px;" alt="Homework">Write a code that reports the sum of odd numbers in a given sequence. The numbers are given with the java call. Let the name of the program be sumOdd so we should be able to call it using the command <code>java sumOdd -numbers-</code>Ignore negative numbers.<code>java sumOdd 66 3 5 44 7 3 8 -5 9 22 6 -4 1250<br />sum of odd numbers in this sequence is 27</code></li>
    
    <li>Write a code that reports the second largest number in a given sequence. The numbers are given with the java call. Let the name of the program be secMax so we should be able to call it using the command <code>java secMax -numbers-</code>Note that max and second max might be the same. <code>java secMax 3 5 7 8 9 22 -5 -3 6 0<br /> second max is 9</code></li>

    <li><img src="images/hw.png" style="height:38px;" alt="Homework">Write a code that reports the second smallest "value" in a given sequence. The numbers are given with the java call. Let the name of the program be secMin so we should be able to call it using the command <code>java secMin -numbers-</code>Note that the min and second min values cannot be the same.<code>java secMin 3 5 28 28 9 22 -5 -3 6 0<br />second min is -3</code></li>
</ol>

<!--Write a code that utilizes a switch statement and array of days to report the day of the week, given a number with the java call. 

Let the name of the program be dayofWeek so we should be able to call it using the command (java dayofWeek -number-)

Your array should contain all days of the week. You can complete and include the following line in your code:

String[] days = {"Monday", "Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"}; 

So here are some examples for clarification:



> java dayofWeek 3

> That day is Wednesday



> java dayofWeek 6

> That day is Saturday



> java dayofWeek 14

> Enter a number between 1 and 7



> java dayofWeek -3

> Enter a number between 1 and 7






Write a code that utilizes a switch statement and reports the month, given a number with the java call. 

Let the name of the program be month so we should be able to call it using the command (java month -number-)

So here are some examples for clarification:



> java month 3

> That month is March



> java month 6

> That month is June
