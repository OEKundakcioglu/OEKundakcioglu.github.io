<h2>Week 4</h2>
           
           <ol>
    <li>Write a code that utilizes a switch statement and array of days to report the day of the week, given a number with the java call. Let the name of the program be dayofWeek so we should be able to call it using the command (java dayofWeek -number-). Your array should contain all days of the week. You can include the following line in your code:

<code>String[] days = {"Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"};</code>
    Here are some examples for clarification:
<code>java dayofWeek 3<br />
That day is Wednesday<br />
java dayofWeek 14<br />
Enter a number between 1 and 7<br />
java dayofWeek -3<br />
Enter a number between 1 and 7</code></li>

<li>Write a code that utilizes a switch statement and reports the month, given a number with the java call. Let the name of the program be month so we should be able to call it using the command (java month -number-). Here are some examples for clarification:
    <code>java month 3<br />
That month is March<br />
java month -3<br />
Enter a number between 1 and 12<br />
</code>
</li>

<li><img src="images/brain.png" style="height:38px;" alt="Think">Write a code that finds the median of given integers. That is, when ordered, the number in the middle; or if there are two numbers in the middle, their average. Here are some examples:
    <code>java median 3 5 8<br />
        The median of 3 5 8 is 5<br />
        java median 8 5 4 -10<br />
        The median of 8 5 4 -10 is 4.5<br />
        </code>
        <b>Hint:</b> First depending on the size of the given array, decide if there would be a number in the middle (odd sized arrays) or not (even sized arrays). Use another array (say flag) and iteratively compute max and min of the given numbers if they are unflagged - initially all are unflagged so start with all false (if array of booleans) or zero (if array of integers) on the flag array. Flag the numbers chosen, that is set maximum's and minimum's associated flags to true or one. Repeat finding this min/max among unflagged for the required number of steps, and you will be left with one or two unflagged numbers. Use that information to compute the median.

<h2>Week 5</h2>

    <li>Define a method that takes a number as input and returns if it is prime or not.</li>    
    <li>Use switch case in a program that will provide the associated letter grade for a point grade, i.e., A if it is in [95-100], C in [65,70), D in [50,55) etc. One should be able to call it using the command <code>java letterGrade -number-</code> </li>

<li>Write a method that returns the difference between the largest and smallest values in a given double array.</li>
<li><img src="images/hw.png" style="height:38px;" alt="Homework">Given an array of integers, write a method that returns true if the array repeats a number "exactly" twice somewhere, and returns false otherwise. Optional: Print out the location and the number.</li>
<li>Clump is defined as a series of 2 or more adjacent elements of the same value. Write a method that returns the number of clumps in a given array.</li>
<li>Given an array, write a method that returns true if there is a place to split the array so that the sum of the numbers on one side is equal to the sum of the remaining numbers on the other side.</li>
<li>A nonnegative integer is called a palindrome if it reads forward and backward in the same way. For example, the numbers 5, 121, 3443, and 123454321 are palindromes. Write a method that takes as input a nonnegative integer and returns true if the number is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns false.</li>

There are three slots, and in each slot, all six possibilities are equally likely. If all three slots show the same outcome at the end of a round, you get back three times your bet. If two of the slots have the same outcome, you receive twice your bet. If none of the slots have the same output, you do not win anything. The initial bet amount is $5. Each time you win (by doubling or tripling), you double your next bet. Each time you lose, you bet the same amount as you did in the previous round. If you do not have enough money, you bet whatever you have (all-in). You will stop playing after 200 rounds, or when you are broke. The output should look like this:

Create 15 random instances (rows) for this table and save it as a csv file.

Compare the solution algorithm we have seen in class this week (include the next item with largest value/weight that fits the knapsack) with the two methods above.

                    Write a Player class with only public variable members and a HashSort method that takes the HashMap and returns a sorted array of Player objects in ascending jersey number. I should be able to do

                    After this line, Player.length should be 5. For example: Player[0].number should be 7 and Player[0].name should be "Petar", Player[2].number should be 9 and Player[2].name should be "Conrad" etc.

Create two players of your choice and place them in a Hashmap&#60;Player, Integer&#62; where the integer value can represent the total points scored, thus you can make up some values. Next, create a new Player object (say player3) that is identical to one of the earlier created players (same name and jersey number). Now try to use player3 as a key and access the corresponding integer value (total points scored) for this player. Can you? If yes, explain how. If not, explain why not.</li>
                <li>Provide a method named sortMyArray that can take a vector of doubles as input (should work with both an ArrayList&#60;double&#62; and a double[] array) and returns a HashMap where the key is the index of that item in the sorted list or array (in ascending order) and value is the item's value. For example if I do the following
<code>double exampleArray={12 , 6 , -1.5, 4.8}<br />
                    HashMap&#60;Integer, double&#62; sortedArray = sortMyArray(exampleArray) <br />

The method should identify two integers from the values of the HashMap, where the first one is divisible by the second. The method must print keys of all such pairs of numbers on console. Pairs of keys cannot be the same. Suppose I have the following keys and values in HashMap named hm:<br />
                        "A":20<br />

                        "E":51<br />
                        I should be able to call divisibles(hm) and it should only print out the associated keys as:
<code>
                        B is divisible by A.<br />
                        
                        B is divisible by C.<br />

                        <li>Create two Java methods: inKeys, inValues. Both methods take 2 inputs from the user, one Hashmap&#60;String, String&#62; and a String.
