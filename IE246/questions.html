<h2>Week 4</h2>
           
           <ol>
    <li>Write a code that utilizes a switch statement and array of days to report the day of the week, given a number with the java call. Let the name of the program be dayofWeek so we should be able to call it using the command (java dayofWeek -number-). Your array should contain all days of the week. You can include the following line in your code:

<code>String[] days = {"Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"};</code>
    Here are some examples for clarification:
<code>java dayofWeek 3<br />
That day is Wednesday<br />
java dayofWeek 14<br />
Enter a number between 1 and 7<br />
java dayofWeek -3<br />
Enter a number between 1 and 7</code></li>

<li>Write a code that utilizes a switch statement and reports the month, given a number with the java call. Let the name of the program be month so we should be able to call it using the command (java month -number-). Here are some examples for clarification:
    <code>java month 3<br />
That month is March<br />
java month -3<br />
Enter a number between 1 and 12<br />
</code>
</li>

<li><img src="images/brain.png" style="height:38px;" alt="Think">Write a code that finds the median of given integers. That is, when ordered, the number in the middle; or if there are two numbers in the middle, their average. Here are some examples:
    <code>java median 3 5 8<br />
        The median of 3 5 8 is 5<br />
        java median 8 5 4 -10<br />
        The median of 8 5 4 -10 is 4.5<br />
        </code>
        <b>Hint:</b> First depending on the size of the given array, decide if there would be a number in the middle (odd sized arrays) or not (even sized arrays). Use another array (say flag) and iteratively compute max and min of the given numbers if they are unflagged - initially all are unflagged so start with all false (if array of booleans) or zero (if array of integers) on the flag array. Flag the numbers chosen, that is set maximum's and minimum's associated flags to true or one. Repeat finding this min/max among unflagged for the required number of steps, and you will be left with one or two unflagged numbers. Use that information to compute the median.

<h2>Week 5</h2>
           
           <ol>

    <li>Define a method that takes a number as input and returns if it is prime or not.</li>    
    <li>Use switch case in a program that will provide the associated letter grade for a point grade, i.e., A if it is in [95-100], C in [65,70), D in [50,55) etc. One should be able to call it using the command <code>java letterGrade -number-</code> </li>
<li>Write a method that takes an array of integer values and returns the reverse of that.</li>
<li><img src="images/hw.png" style="height:38px;" alt="Homework">Write a method that prints the common elements between two arrays of strings.</li>
<li>Write a method that returns the middle character of a string.</li>
<li><img src="images/hw.png" style="height:38px;" alt="Homework">Write a method that returns the number of even integers in a given array.</li>
<li>Write a method that returns the difference between the largest and smallest values in a given double array.</li>
<li><img src="images/hw.png" style="height:38px;" alt="Homework">Given an array of integers, write a method that returns true if the array repeats a number "exactly" twice somewhere, and returns false otherwise. Optional: Print out the location and the number.</li>
<li>Clump is defined as a series of 2 or more adjacent elements of the same value. Write a method that returns the number of clumps in a given array.</li>
<li>Given an array, write a method that returns true if there is a place to split the array so that the sum of the numbers on one side is equal to the sum of the remaining numbers on the other side.</li>
<li>A nonnegative integer is called a palindrome if it reads forward and backward in the same way. For example, the numbers 5, 121, 3443, and 123454321 are palindromes. Write a method that takes as input a nonnegative integer and returns true if the number is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns false.</li>
