# Research

My research interests lie primarily in the fields of _supply chain management_ and _data science_ spanning **decision analytics** and **mathematical optimization** problems. 

I work on _inventory control_ under _demand and supply uncertainty_. These decision problems are ubiquitous in **healthcare** and **humanitarian aid operations**. I have also studied various mathematical optimization problems in production and service systems, including scheduling, lot sizing, routing, and pricing.

My research also involves combinatorial optimization approaches in numerous subdomains of data science, including **supervised learning** and **time series analysis**. In addition, I have applied some of these techniques to the toxicological evaluation of nanoparticles and interpreting EEG data.
